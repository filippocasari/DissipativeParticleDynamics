# Dissipative Particle Dynamics
### Assignment 4 Particles Method
To run the experiments, use Cmake. Some instructions within CmakeLists.txt are platform-dependent. So, ensure you have changed hard-coded linking.\\
Thank to [matplolibcpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) for the plotting library in cpp.
Args to pass:
```bash
./AS4PM delta_t
```
where delta_t is a double (seconds)

__NOTE__: sometimes, the program does not run properly because matplotlibcpp is not maintained anymore, and crashes. However, if this happened, you may try several times.
